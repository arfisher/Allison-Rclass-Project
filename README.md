# Organization

Please see the `README.md` files in each folder for more details.

* This template has been populated with _Palmer Penguins_ morphology and life history data in the `Raw_data` folder.
* The `Processing_code` folder contains several files that load the raw data, perform a bit of cleaning, and save the result in the `Processed_data` folder.
* The `Analysis_code` folder contains several files that load the processed data, do an exploratory analysis, and fit a simple model. These files produce figures and some numeric output (tables), which are saved to the `results` folder.
* The `Products` folder contains an example `bibtex` and CSL style files for references. Those files are used by the example manuscript and slides.
* The  `Manuscript` folder contains a template for a report written as Quarto file. There is also a sub-folder containing an example template for a supplementary material file as is common in scientific articles these days.
* The `slides` folder contains a basic example of slides made with Quarto.

For the first project, only Processing code has been modified with processed data as the output.
