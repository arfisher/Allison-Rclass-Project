# Summary/Abstract
Investigating which penguins have more complete clutches (observed as having 2 eggs in their nest).


{{< pagebreak >}}


# Introduction

## General Background Information
I assume having a complete clutch means that indiviual has higher reproductive fitness. We can see which variables (mass, species) are associated with this fitness.

## Description of data and data source


Here we describe an analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset [@Horst:2020], which contains data on three species of penguins from the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network [@Gorman:2014].

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

Our research questions are:

1. Is body mass (g) associated with clutch completion?
2. Is species associated with clutch completion?
3. Is body mass(g) associated with species?
4. Within species, how is body mass (g) associated with clutch completion?

# Methods


We cleaned the dataset which had typos, made exploratory plots, and made a summary table. Then I made figures for each of our questions and tested patterns with ttest and ANOVA.


## Data acquisition

Data came from the preloaded palmerpenguins dataset on base R [@Horst:2020]. It was cleaned using this script <https://github.com/arfisher/Allison-Rclass-Project/blob/065fc1b7823d1bc0150e8751f6a50cc06f3550ef/Code/Processing_code/project1.qmd>.



## Statistical analysis
Welch two sample t-test was used to compare body mass (g) between individuals with completed or non completed clutches. Two one-way ANOVAs were used to see if 1) clutch completion differs between species and 2) body mass differs between species.

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis


@tbl-summary_table shows a summary of the data.

```{r , results="asis"}
#| label: tbl-summary_table
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")  # supresses printing of NAs
resulttable=readRDS("../../Results/summary_table.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, digits=2)
```

## Size on Clutch Completion

Analysis of size by clutch completion and species.

We found that those with complete clutches substantially larger than those without
(@fig-mass_clutch_bars, t-test P-value < 0.05 ).

```{r}
#| label: fig-mass_clutch_bars
#| fig-cap: "Body mass distributions of Clutch Completion categories."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Results/mass_clutch_bars.png")
```
```{r}
#| label: fig-mass_clutch_density
#| fig-cap: "Body mass distributions of Clutch Completion categories."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Results/mass_clutch_density.png")
```


We found that Gentoos have the highest number of complete clutches, followed by Adelie and Chinstrap with the lowest
(@fig-species_clutch_bars, ANOVA P-value < 0.005 ).

```{r}
#| label: fig-species_clutch_bars
#| fig-cap: "Proportion of clutch completion of the three species of penguin."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Results/species_clutch_bars.png")
```

```{r , results="asis"}
#| label: tbl-cc_species_anova
#| tbl-cap: "Differences in clutch completion by species."
#| echo: FALSE
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
resulttable=readRDS("../../Results/cc_species_anova.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, digits=2)
```
We found that Gentoos have the largest body size, followed by Adelie and Chinstrap at about the same size.
(@fig-mass_species_bars, ANOVA P-value < 0.0001 ).

```{r}
#| label: fig-mass_species_bars
#| fig-cap: "Body mass distributions of the three species of penguin."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Results/mass_species_bars.png")
```

```{r , results="asis"}
#| label: tbl-mass_species_anova
#| tbl-cap: "Differences in mass (g) by species."
#| echo: FALSE
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
resulttable=readRDS("../../Results/mass_species_anova.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, digits=2)
```

We found that among Chinstrap and Gentoos, those with complete clutches fall on the higher end of the body size distribution. In Adelies, those with complete clutches fall in the middle of the range with larger and smaller indiviuals having fewer complete clutches.

```{r}
#| label: fig-mass_species_clutchcompletion
#| fig-cap: "Density of Clutch Completion across body mass within species."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Results/mass_species_clutchcompletion.png")
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
We found that penguins with complete clutches tend to be larger. We also found Gentoos have more clutch completion than other species. Further investigation shows these findings may be confounded as Gentoos have larger body size in general. When looking at the species separately, we found that the actual range of body size for successful clutch completion is different across species.

## Strengths and Limitations
There are surely other factors which influence clutch completion like age, resource availability, and life history traits.

## Conclusions
We showed that we cannot generalize likelihood to have a complete clutch by body size or species alone because there are interactions between these traits.
