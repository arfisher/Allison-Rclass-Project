This Quarto file loads the cleaned Palmer Penguins data and does some initial analysis.

Load the R script to begin analysis.

```{r }
#| cache = FALSE
knitr::read_chunk('statistical_analysis.R')
```

Require packages and filepaths.

```{r setup}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
```

Load custom function which pastes the path to the output files.

```{r functions}
```

Load in the processed data from Project1 as a .rds file

```{r loaddata}
```

# Creating a summary table

In order to present the reader or listener with an overview of the data in a digestible way, a summary table must be created. This includes sample size (N) for all variables and additional basic statsistics (counts, means, and standard errors) for continuous data.

I used skimr to produce a summary tibble and then coerced it into a data frame. Then I looked at the variables automatically generated to see which elements to include or ignore. I added a column for "N" by counting the number of rows and subtracting the number of missing values to find out how many samples each variable has.

```{r, summarize}
```

## Select columns for a final summary table

I grabbed only the columns of interest (variable name, N, mean, SD, and counts) and changed SD to SE by dividing by the square root of the sample size.

I changed the names to be nicer than the skim output and set the number of digits per entry to 2.

```{r summary.table, results="asis"}
```
This is saved as an .rds file.


# How to complete a clutch?

I have an idea that clutch completion (observation of a nest with full clutch, i.e., 2 eggs) can tell us about fitness of individuals. Let's find out what factors are assosciated with clutch completion.

Do more massive penguins have more clutch success?

```{r mass_clutch_boxplot}
```
```{r mass_clutch_density}
```

It seems those with successful clutches may have slightly higher mass.
Let's do a t-test to see if this is significant.
```{r mass_clutch_ttest}
```
And it is! Good to know

Now, which species have more clutch completion?

```{r species_clutch_plot}
```
It looks like Gentoo is most successful followed by Adelie with Chinstrap having least completion.
Let's see if this is significant with ANOVA. I am converting the clutch completion (yes/no) variable to binary so it has a numerical representation in this test.

```{r clutchcompletion_species_aov}
```
So they do have different amounts of complete clutches

But we know mass has an effect on clutch completion.
Let's see if the species have different masses.

```{r mass_species_boxplot}
```
And let's see if it's significant with ANOVA

```{r mass_species_aov}
```
And it is again.

So those with successful clutches have higher masses and species have different levels of clutch completion ... but species have different masses. This means that by lumping all the species together when looking at mass, we may be missing the big picture of the effect of mass on clutch completion within each species.

Let's see a density plot of clutch success by mass with species as a facet.
```{r mass_species_clutch_density}
```
Now we can see that while more massive Gentoos and Chinstraps have more complete clutches, mid-sized Adelies are actually more likely to have complete clutches. They actually have less success at higher masses.
This is an interesting pattern about mass and reproductive fitness across species which we wouldn't have seen if it weren't for breaking down this distinction.
